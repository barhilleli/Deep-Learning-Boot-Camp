    "This tutorial shows how to use PyTorch to train a Deep Q Learning (DQN) agent\n",
    "on the CartPole-v0 task from the <span style=\"color:red\">[OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com)</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is mainly taken from: </br> \n",

    "\n",
    "A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The system is controlled by applying a force of +1 or -1 to the cart. The pendulum starts upright, and the goal is to prevent it from falling over. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:green\">*A reward of +1 is provided for every timestep that the pole remains upright. The episode ends when the pole is more than 15 degrees from vertical, or the cart moves more than 2.4 units from the center*.</span> </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "As the agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses\n",
    "an action, the environment *transitions* to a new state, and also\n",
    "returns a reward that indicates the consequences of the action. In this\n",
    "task, the environment terminates if the pole falls over too far.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real\n",
    "values representing the environment state (position, velocity, etc.).\n",
    "However, neural networks can solve the task purely by looking at the\n",
    "scene, so we'll use a patch of the screen centered on the cart as an\n",
    "input. Because of this, our results aren't directly comparable to the\n",
    "ones from the official leaderboard - our task is much harder.\n",
    "Unfortunately this does slow down the training, because we have to\n",
    "render all the frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, we will present the state as the difference between\n",
    "the current screen patch and the previous one. This will allow the agent\n",
